# Blender Cheat Sheet

## Basics

* (X, Y, Z) = (right, forward, up) (right-handed)
* Default units: meters

## Navigation in Viewport

* ``MMB`` (Middle Mouse Button) drag to orbit
* ``Shift-MMB`` move side to side
* ``Wheel`` zoom in and out
* ``HorizontalWheel`` pan side to side
* ``Ctrl-drag MMB`` zoom in and out (finer grained)
* ``Numpad2``, ``Numpad4``, ``Numpad6``, ``Numpad8`` step viewing angle down, left, right, up
* ``Numpad1`` orthographic view along -Y-axis
* ``Numpad3`` orthographic view along X-axis
* ``Numpad7`` orthographic view along Z-axis
* ``Home`` change view so you can see all objects
* ``Numpad0`` jump to camera view
* ``Ctrl-Alt-Numpad0`` set camera to current view
* ``Numpad5`` switch between ortho and perspective
* ``Numpad9`` rotate view 180Â°

## Adding Objects
* 3D cursor crosshair with red and white signal
* ``Shift-Right-Click`` move 3D cursor
* ``Shift-S`` show selection and cursor circular menu
  * "Cursor to World Origin"
* ``Shift-A`` pop up the "Add" menu
* ``T`` show and hide the tools palette
* ``N`` to show/hide the Sidebar
* ``G`` to grab selected object and move it around
* ``X`` constrain movement to X-axis
* ``Y`` constrain movement to Y-axis
* ``Z`` constrain movement to Z-axis

## Display Modes
* Wireframe
* Solid
* Material Preview (HDRI Skybox)
* Rendered
* X-Ray mode (Wireframe and Solid only)

## Rendering
* ``F12`` to render
* Principled BSDF shader
* Right Click on Object
  * Shade Smooth

## Editing
* ``Tab`` to toggle between Object and Edit mode
* ``Ctrl-Tab`` select mode pie menu
* ``1`` select vertices
* ``2`` select edges
* ``3`` select faces
* ``G`` move selected
* ``E`` extrude
* ``Ctrl-R`` loop cut
* "And if you want to move the verts, always use double G to slide the verts on the edge. This will keep the plane flat."
